                <p>
                    <i>Are we there yet?</i>
                </p>

                <p>Kids get bored very quickly, and if you&rsquo;ve got a long journey planned it can be a job to keep them entertained. </p>

                <p>So we&rsquo;ve lined up some car games to help make those miles pass quicker.</p>

                <h3 id="what-am-i-counting">1. What am I counting?</h3>

                <p><strong>How to play:</strong> This is an easy one. Pick a player to count something outside &ndash; traffic lights, pedestrians, dogs, houses, road signs. They can&rsquo;t tell anyone what they&rsquo;re counting.</p>

                <p>Every time they pass the object they&rsquo;ve picked, the player has to count out loud, adding to their score. The rest of the players have to guess what&rsquo;s being counted. </p>

                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Try not to pick things that are rarely seen, like houses with three chimneys or orange cars parked on a driveway. If the player&rsquo;s object hasn&rsquo;t been seen for three miles, then you can mix things up by ending their go.</p>

                <h3 id="guess-who">2. Guess who</h3>

                <p><strong>How to play:</strong> Player one picks a person &ndash; it has to be someone everyone in the car would know &ndash; and all the other players have to ask questions to figure out who it is. Player one can only answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. </p>

                <p>The interrogation could go along the lines of:</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Is your person a man?</strong> Yes <br>
                    <strong>Is he over 50?</strong> No <br>
                    <strong>Is he famous?</strong> Yes <br>
                    <strong>Is he a singer?</strong> No <br>
                    <strong>Does he play sport?</strong> Yes <br>
                </p>

                <p>And so on&hellip; (we were thinking of Crystal Palace and Wales midfielder Joe Ledley, by the way).</p>

                <h3 id="guess-the-next-car">3. Guess the next car</h3>

                <p><strong>How to play:</strong> This is a good one for country roads or areas with less traffic.</p>

                <p>It&rsquo;s simple; all the passengers have to guess the colour of the next car coming round the bend. If you get it right, then you get a point. You can also add the model of car if you&rsquo;re feeling brave.</p>

                <h3 id="the-never-ending-sentence">4. The never&ndash;ending sentence</h3>

                <p><strong>How to play:</strong> This game is trickier than it first seems. </p>

                <p>One player says a sentence without finishing it, and the next player has to carry it on without bringing the sentence to a full stop. If a player finishes the sentence, then they&rsquo;re out.</p>

                <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Player one:</strong> I went shopping the other day and bought&hellip;<br>
                <strong>Player two:</strong> A bag of potatoes but one was&hellip;<br>
                <strong>Player three:</strong> Mouldy so I took them back and exchanged them for&hellip;<br>
                <strong>Player four:</strong> A new t-shirt, for when we go to&hellip;</p>

                <h3 id="yes-no-game">5. Yes/No game</h3>

                <p><strong>How to play:</strong> Another classic that shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked, the yes/no game can catch out even the strongest-willed passengers. </p>

                <p>The player in the spotlight gets asked a bunch of questions, but they&rsquo;re not allowed to answer &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo;. They can&rsquo;t use the same answer twice and there can&rsquo;t be any drawn out pausing.</p>

                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you say things like &ldquo;really?&rdquo; or &ldquo;are you sure&rdquo; this usually triggers a spontaneous &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; response. </p>

                <h3 id="alphabet-game">6. Alphabet game</h3>

                <p><strong>How to play:</strong> Pick a theme, for example girl&rsquo;s names, then go through the alphabet &ndash; so everybody must come up with a girl&rsquo;s name beginning with A, then B, then C&hellip; etc.</p>

                <p>For example:</p>

                <p><strong>Round one:</strong> Amanda, Amy, Angelica, Alice, Ava<br>
                <strong>Round two:</strong> Belinda, Betty, Belle, Betsy, Beth</p>

                <p>Take turns to go first, and if you can&rsquo;t think of a name beginning with that letter (Ys and Zs are always pretty hard!) then you lose a life. Also, you can&rsquo;t repeat the name or take too long.</p>

                <p>Other categories we suggest: birds, dogs, drinks, TV shows, films and cartoon characters.</p>

                <h3 id="rhyming-celebs">7. Rhyming celebs</h3>

                <p><strong>How to play:</strong> Now&rsquo;s your chance to create your own celebrity rhyming slang. Forget the apples and pears or the dog and bone, start making up some of your own.</p>

                <p>He enjoys canned goods &ndash; it&rsquo;s Tiger Woods<br>
                She once owned a Jeep &ndash; meet Meryl Streep<br>
                Children run miles &ndash; it&rsquo;s Adrian Chiles</p>

                <p>You get the idea.</p>

                <p>We hope these games will make longer car journeys a bit more bearable for the whole family &ndash; and all without a tablet or mobile phone in sight!</p>
