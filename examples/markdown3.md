If you&rsquo;ve got children, you&rsquo;ll want their rooms to be fun, but also a safe place where they&rsquo;ll happily go to sleep.

Here are some ideas on how to decorate their bedrooms, that won&rsquo;t break the bank&mldr;

### Sort out their storage

One of the biggest headaches for any parent is constantly tripping over toys whenever you go into your child&rsquo;s bedroom.

Make the most of space under the bed so you can store books and toys, or create a stuffed animal cage so there aren&rsquo;t endless teddies piled up on the bed. All you need is an old bookcase that you don&rsquo;t mind drilling holes in, and some bungee cord to thread through and hold the animals in place. You don&rsquo;t have to spend a fortune on expensive bespoke storage solutions &ndash; colourful plastic buckets or bins will do. And they work just as well at holding Lego pieces, cars or other small toys.

### Light up their world

When choosing how to light your child&rsquo;s bedroom, remember that it&rsquo;s often a good idea to go for recessed lights, as these are less likely to get broken by flying toys or balls. 

Lamps are usually only suitable if they can be positioned out of reach, or if you have slightly older children who are less likely to pull them over. Many children need to sleep with a nightlight, and warm glow fairy lights can give their room a magical feel. Glow-in-the-dark stars can also brighten up walls and ceilings during the night, creating the feeling for your children that they&rsquo;re sleeping out under the night sky.

### Stay safe

Heavy chests of drawers and cupboards can be a real hazard to small children who have a habit of pulling out the drawers and climbing on them.  

Stop large items of furniture from toppling by attaching them to walls using fixing brackets, and if you are hanging pictures in your child&rsquo;s room, always make sure they&rsquo;re firmly secured and out of reach. Don&rsquo;t put the bed under a window either, particularly if you haven&rsquo;t got window locks, and make sure any blind cords are tied up.

### Give them their own art gallery

Most children love creating their own artwork, so why not dedicate one of the walls in the room to their paintings and pictures?

Low-cost frames will help make them look really special and they can be easily updated with their latest creations whenever they want. You could also paint one section of wall with blackboard paint, so they can use chalk on the wall to draw or practise their writing.

### Get sewing

You don&rsquo;t have to be a whizz on the sewing machine to create something handmade and unique for your child&rsquo;s bedroom.

Start with something simple like bunting which you can create from any old fabric remnants you might have lying around. You might then want to progress to something like a quilt. Not only will it be an item only they have, but it&rsquo;s also something that can see them through to adulthood. And it&rsquo;ll be very special to them because you&rsquo;ve created it.

### Change your d&eacute;cor with stickers

Tempting as it may be to go wild with the paint and design a mural that your toddler will love, the risk is that you&rsquo;ll have to start from scratch again in a couple of years when they get sick of it or move onto the next fad.

An easier option is to choose a subtle base colour for the walls and then use wall stickers to create a bit of drama. That way, when your child fancies a change, all you have to do is peel it off and slap on a new one.
